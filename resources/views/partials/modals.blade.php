                        <p>In the next couple of weeks, the pilot of the exoskeleton will be selected among several
                            paraplegic patients. We are working closely with Radboud UMC to select the right canditate.
                            He/she will be the main character of the team and will be involved
                            intensively in the project over the coming year. In addition, a national documentary will
                            be created by an external company about his/her life from the start of the project until the
                            exoskeleton race during the Cybathlon 2016.
                            More information will be available when the pilot has been selected.

                        <p>
                            The "MARCH" exoskeleton will be based upon the design of it's predecessor: "Mindwalker".
                            Drastic improvements are to be made however, to ensure the MARCH will be one of a kind
                            prototype capable of reshaping paraplegic healthcare as we know it today.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The suit is currently powered by 6 electronic actuators to simulate the hip and knee joints,
                            which are all connected to an EtherCAT master interface which, in turn, is controlled using
                            Simulink. The user controls the actions of the suit by displacing his/her center of mass. It
                            has been shown that both healthy and paraplegic pilots can easily control their actions in
                            such a way. The Mindwalker is an advanced machine, but for MARCH, it does not stop there. In
                            pursuit of D:DREAM status, we intend to not just realise an advanced machine, but realise an
                            extremely advanced machine. For instance, research conducted on the Mindwalker suggested
                            algorithms to control hip ab/adduction may improve stability. And already, the team is
                            bringing forth many other ideas including adding an extra joint in the ankles for a wider
                            range of possible movements to adding advanced self-learning algorithms helping both MARCH
                            and it's pilot in "learning to walk again".

                        <img class="img-responsive img-centered" src="http://placehold.it/700x200" alt="">

                        <p>
                            The symbitron project is a European research group that strive to overcome the existing
                            technical limitations of powered exoskeletons, to enhance state-of-the-art knowledge on
                            walking, balance and
                            man-machine interaction, and thereby to bring independent walking with tailor-fitted,
                            wearable exoskeletons within reach of the patient.</p>

                        <p>
                            They goal is for a patient-driven methodology in which the design and control of the
                            wearable exoskeleton and the interface between the exoskeleton and patient are customized to
                            the unique features (impairments and remaining capacities) of each individual patient.
                            Their ambition is to give each personalized exoskeleton human-like neuromuscular properties
                            resulting in a paradigm shift in the field of robot-assisted living. They aim to restore
                            natural symbiotic interactions between paralysed legs and the rest of the body, by
                            optimizing tailor made biological inspired wearable exoskeletons and symbiotic man-machine
                            interactions. With this novel approach they expect a breakthrough in the achievements and
                            application of wearable exoskeleton technology for people with gait disorders.

                            Project MARCH is the upcoming prestigious Dream Team of the Delft University of Technology.
                            With a group of ambitious students of different backgrounds, we are making Delft’s first
                            exoskeleton. Our mission is to give paraplegics a second chance to walk again with the
                            assistance of our
                            exoskeleton. We want to remove barriers between the public, people with disabilities and
                            science with our project.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Our goal is to compete and win the Cybathlon 2016 in Zurich! The Cybathlon is a
                            tournament for racing pilots with disabilities who are using advanced assistive devices
                            including robotic technologies.
                        </p>
